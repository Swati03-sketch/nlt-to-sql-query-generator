NLT-TO-SQL-Generator

A Text-to-SQL Query Generator that converts natural language text into executable SQL queries. It uses Machine Learning and NLP techniques with models such as T5-small and text-processing libraries like NLTK. The system connects to an SQLite database for training, testing, validation, and executing the generated queries.
This tool enables users to interact with a database by simply entering natural language text—no SQL knowledge required.
